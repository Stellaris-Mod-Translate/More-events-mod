Inside it, landscape engineers have found an alien structure of some sort. Impervious to scans, it appears to be of highly advanced technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."

The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
