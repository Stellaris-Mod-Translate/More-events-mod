#Julius' Comet has been making rounds through the [Capital_Scope.Solar_System.GetName] System for thousands of years and was repeatedly seen in the sky of [Capital_Scope.GetName] throughout [root.GetSpeciesAdj] history. However, our astronomers inform us that it has finished its incredibly complex path and left the confines of the system forever. \n\nIt is now beyond the tracking range of our sensors and is not projected to return to charted space for many millennia."
#Note for translators: The game will generate a random leader to give comet a name and since it's synched, it will be in English. There's no real reason to keep it beside aesthetics, so make two descriptions based on "mem_comet_lost.1.desc" if it's not apropriate to have latin-lettered name in the event.
