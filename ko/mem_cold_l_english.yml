mem_cold_dig_site_desc: "§Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!의 표면 온도는 예상되는 온도보다 극도로 춥습니다. 지금은 거주가 불가능한 천체이기는 하나, [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] 표면에 산재해있는 오래된 산업 문명 유적으로 보아 상대적으로 최근에 급격한 기후 변화가 있었던것 같습니다."
mem_cold.1.name: "죽은 행성"
mem_cold.1.desc: "§Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! 표면에서 진행한 고고학 조사 결과, 초기 조사가 옳았다는 결론이 내려졌습니다. 이 행성에는 확실히 생명이 가득했으며, 스스로를 §S호리프§!라고 불렀던 거대 포유류 지성체의 고향이었습니다. 초기 우주시대 수준의 기술을 보유하고 있었으며, 문명이 몰락할 당시까지도 고도의 산업화와 기술 개발 단계를 거치고 있었습니다. 그렇지만 부족한 에너지로 문명의 발전이 더뎌지기 시작한 것 같습니다. 행성에는 화석 연료도 충분히 존재하지 않았고, 핵분열성 물질도 부족했습니다. \n\n대량살상무기를 만들 기술이 있었고 가지고도 있었지만, 이들은 대전쟁을 일으키지도 않았고 그렇다고 외계에서 누군가 쳐들어 오지도 않았고 사회적 불안 요소가 발생한 것도 아니였습니다. 하지만 이 행성에 남아있는 호리프 종족의 건물, 토양 상태, 알 수 없는 곳에서 분출되는 전리 방사선으로 보아 이 행성이 무언가 이상하다는 것은 확실합니다. \n\n이 문명을 파괴한 것이 대체 무엇인지 아직 정확한 것이 밝혀지지 않았지만, 한 밤 중에 모든 생명체들이 목숨을 잃은 것 같습니다. 만약 무기로 이 행성의 생명체들이 모두 몰살당한 것이라면, 우리가 이전에 보지 못한 새로운 것임이 분명할 것입니다."
mem_cold.2.name: "State of Decay"
mem_cold.2.desc: "The more §Y[Leader.GetName]§! and [Leader.GetHerHis] expedition explore the ruins of Horeef civilization, the more strange occurrences they come across. \n\n이전에 탐지되었던 방사선은 방사선 물질에서 방출되고 있던 것이 아니었습니다. 그 대신, 수백만 년의 반감기를 가진 안정동위원소가 일반적인 방사선 장비로도 측정될 정도로 극도로 빠른 속도로 붕괴되고 있었습니다. Complex compounds are measurably decomposing in ways inconsistent with any chemical process we could expect to happen at freezing temperatures. Even the starry sky seems dimmer somehow when observed from the surface of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]. \n\nThese phenomena are spreading radially from a spot on one of the larger landmasses. This would likely be their source."
mem_cold.3.name: "The Sky Razor Project"
mem_cold.3.desc: "The exploration of the origin point of the strange anomalies that plague §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! has proven to be perilous and fruitless - the area itself has mostly turned into radioactive shifting sand. However, data from there was transferred to remote locations for backup, and some of those are still usable. \n\nAs established earlier, the Horeef struggled with energy shortages to sustain their civilization, and to combat this they started a project codenamed §SSky Razor§!. They were hoping to discover an unlimited source of energy by opening some sort of dimensional rift and syphoning it from another universe. \n\nThe facility where research was conducted worked and sent reports up until the disaster that destroyed the Horeef civilization, but from the look of it, they were not successful. In fact, according to §Y[Leader.GetName]§!, they weren't even close to any kind of working prototype - their research was complete nonsense. \n\nThis means it's highly unlikely Sky Razor is responsible for planet's destruction. Yet, there's obviously a link."
mem_cold.4.name: "A Hole in the World"
mem_cold.4.desc: "Further measurements taken at the site of the former Sky Razor facility and extensive research of the reports lead §Y[Leader.GetName]§! to the startling conclusion that the Horeef were not responsible for their destruction: someone else was. \n\nThe Sky Razor researchers were not even close to opening any kind of rift, that much is clear, but it seems someone, in a different universe - likely an alternate universe version of the Horeef - did. Their equivalent of Sky Razor was successful and tapped into our universe for an unlimited supply of energy by creating a rift on the very same spot where the Sky Razor facility stood. The initial opening caused a large amount of energy to be syphoned from the local space. This energy included the heat and energy of chemical and nuclear bonds, causing matter to be ripped apart. This effect was most devastating at the site of Sky Razor, but remained fatal to all forms life elsewhere, especially when coupled with a massive drop in temperature. \n\nThe flow of energy has slowed down since but remains a constant drain, with the rift continuing to syphon energy from the planet. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do to collapse the rift from our side or contact the other - even assuming anyone is still artificially keeping the rift open and it's not a self-sustaining runaway process. \n\nOn the other hand, as long as we steer clear of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, we would not experience any negative effect, as the drain strength decreases exponentially. If this process continues, the life cycle of the §Y[From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName]§! system's star will be shortened by merely a few thousand years and the heat death of the universe will come about a decade sooner. Hardly something to worry about."
mem_cold.4.a: "This is still troubling."
mem_cold_irradiated_trait: "Irradiated"
mem_cold_irradiated_trait_desc: "This leader was subjected to a massive amount of exotic radiation. No superpowers have manifested so far, malignant neoplasms are expected in large numbers however."
