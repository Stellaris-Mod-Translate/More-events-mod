[root.Leader.GetName], though able to pinpoint its source, quickly discarded the idea of trying to reach it as too dangerous.\n\nBack aboard the [root.GetName], [root.Leader.GetSheHe] managed to decipher the recorded transmission.\n\nIt consisted of several minutes of video feed starting in the middle of what appears to have been a live news report about a public celebration.\n\n§SLarge parades are carrying debris through the streets accompanied by cheering masses, until suddenly the atmosphere changes completely and panic spreads. Then the view is abruptly moved towards the darkening sky. A burning wreck draws a fiery line as it falls towards the ground. Before it reaches the surface, there are giant explosions all around and the video ends.§!\n\nThere is not enough material to translate what has been said, but [root.Leader.GetName] takes this as proof that [From.GetName] fell victim to ballistic bombardment by an alien fleet.

The facility, which is rather primitive by our standards, is filled with basic stasis units housing thousands of dead beings.\n\nSearching through the data fragments stored in the facility's computer system, our science team could piece together the dire situation the inhabitants of [From.GetName] faced. Their civilization had been attacked by a technological superior force multiple times in the past. Their growing resistance was met with increasingly brutal retaliations, and they feared - rightfully, it seems - that their world would fall to these attacks. As a means to restart their civilization should the worst happen, this hidden base was installed to act as an ark to preserve their brightest minds as well as sufficient genetic variety to reboot their civilisation.\n\nHowever, they had not expected their foes to turn their homeworld into a lifeless and entirely uninhabitable rock. The 'hidden' base appears to have been purposefully spared - given that we were able to detect it, it is to be expected their foe did too. As stated in the logs, the stasis system shut down according to schedule ten years after contact with the surface had been lost. [root.Leader.GetName] cannot even start to imagine the dread and despair these people must have felt upon realizing their situation. Equipped with only two shuttle craft lacking FTL-capability and no world to return to, they were stranded. Shortly after that, the stasis system was reactivated indefinitely."

The facility, which is rather primitive by our standards, is filled with basic stasis units housing thousands of dead beings.\n\nSearching through the data fragments stored in the facility's computer system, our science team could piece together the dire situation the inhabitants of [From.GetName] faced. Their civilization had been attacked by a technological superior force multiple times in the past. Their growing resistance was met with increasingly brutal retaliations, and they feared - rightfully, it seems - that their world would fall to these attacks. As a means to restart their civilization should the worst happen, this hidden base was installed to act as an ark to preserve their brightest minds as well as sufficient genetic variety to reboot their civilisation.\n\nHowever, they had not expected their foes to turn their homeworld into a lifeless and entirely uninhabitable rock. The 'hidden' base appears to have been purposefully spared - given that we were able to detect it, it is to be expected their foe did too. As stated in the logs, the stasis system shut down according to schedule ten years after contact with the surface had been lost. It is hard to even start to imagine the dread and despair the survivors must have felt upon realizing their situation. Equipped with only two shuttle craft lacking FTL-capability and no world to return to, they were stranded. Shortly after that, the stasis system was reactivated indefinitely."

Several personnel experienced what they described as psychotic episodes during these moments. Affected by this phenomenon as well, the chief scientist decided to return to the shuttle, fearing that remaining longer would put the team in danger. However, before they could lift off, another blackout occurred, lasting for much longer than any before that point. When communications could be re-established, a very shaken sounding scientist reported that they are going to leave immediately. Half of them were still unconscious when they arrived at the rendezvous coordinates with the [root.GetName].\n\nAfter having recovered, [root.Leader.GetName] reports having experienced the collective death of an entire world at the hands of a merciless foe. According to [root.Leader.GetHisHer] theory, [From.GetName]'s inhabitants must have possessed extensive psychic capabilities, which led to their terrifying last moments being imprinted into the planet itself. Though physically unharmed, the events have had a lasting effect on [root.Leader.GetHimHer].\n\nFurther scans showed traces of a superdense compound spread across the planet's surface, which is likely to originate from the weapons used in its destruction, supporting [root.Leader.GetName]'s claims."

These turned out to be artificial satellites containing data cores.

Though the application of this technology to our own fleet might seem tempting at first, our experiments demonstrated problematic side-effects caused by this protective device. The suppression of energy transmission is not limited on energy coming from outside its zone of effect but affects internal ship systems as well. So far, no way of shielding them from the damper field's effects has been found.\n\nOur [root.GetScientistResearchSubroutinePlural] have only managed to gain a rudimentary understanding of the technology's underlying scientific principles.
