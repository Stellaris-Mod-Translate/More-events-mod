mem_charmak.1.name: "차르막"
mem_charmal.1.desc: "함선의 내부는 미라화된 시체들로 가득했습니다. 일부 시체들은 비명횡사한 것으로 보이나, 대부분은 기아와 생명유지장치 고장으로 인해 사망했습니다. 시체들 모두는 스스로를 §S차르막§!이라 불렀던 작지만 신체적으로 생존력이 강했던 조류 종족이였으며 약 800년 전 이 은하에서 매우 활동적이였던 종족이었습니다. \n\n이들의 신체는 우주 태생 성질을 가진 것으로 보이며, 이 함선과 같이 우주선에 거주하기 위해 과거에 살던 행성을 떠난것으로 보입니다."
mem_charmak.2.name: "The Charmak Horde"
mem_charmak.2.desc: "Further study of the ship found on [From.Planet.GetName] and various artefacts aboard has granted us more insights into the §SCharmak§! society. \n\nThe Charmak organized their clan-based society primarily based on physical strength and martial prowess. The strong would violently coerce their weaker brethren to follow their orders, while fighting one another for the dominance. The strongest of them would be called a §YCharmakar§! and serve as a leader of a clan. \n\nThe life of Charmak was short and brutal, but for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with them, it was much worse. They were a society of planet looters, attacking planetside settlements with reckless disregard for personal safety, killing and pillaging everything they came across. \n\nVery few of their activities didn't revolve around this never-ending looting - most of those not involved in combat would work on manufacturing and designing new weapons; the select few who lived to become too injured or infirm to fight or work would find employment creating art to inspire their comrades to pillage harder or cataloguing trophies gained in the recent raids."
mem_charmak.3.name: "The Charmakarade"
mem_charmak.3.desc: "The purpose of the ship found in orbit above [From.Planet.GetName] has become clearer. The vessel was a flagship of one of the most prominent and prosperous clans in the Charmak horde and a site of regular meetings of Charmakars from all over the horde known as §SThe Charmakarade§!. \n\nThe clans were mostly insular, but occasionally they had to gather together to establish alliances, coordinate attacks or address other concerns of the entire horde. On average, a Charmakarade ended with 53% of the Charmakars in agreement and other 47% dead."
mem_charmak.4.name: "The Orange Freaks"
mem_charmak.4.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports finding records from the last Charmakarade ever held on a ship [Leader.GetSheHe] is studying. It took place not long before the collapse of Charmak civilisation. \n\nThe only item on the agenda was a new foe the horde had encountered - the Charmaks did not care to learn their identity, referring to them simply as §SOrange Freaks§!. They had conducted a series of hit-and-run attacks on smaller, more isolated clans in the horde, which for the Charmak was something unheard of - and finding themselves on the receiving end of the attacks for once was a cause of great concern. \n\nMany Charmakars pledged their clan's support to the retaliation campaign."
mem_charmak.5.name: "Fatal Ruminations"
mem_charmak.5.desc: "The records of the last years of the Charmak society are scarce, but §Y[Leader.GetName]§! now believes that [Leader.GetSheHe] can reconstruct their downfall. \n\nThe Charmak campaign was successful and the entire civilisation of the §SOrange Freaks§! was wiped out as a result. Large numbers of Charmak who were captured in the initial raids were found, liberated and publicly shamed for their weakness, however something strange happened afterwards. \n\nIt appears their captors were trying to turn their prisoners to their side and in doing so discussed in great detail their social and political differences. The captives then passed what they learned on to the rest of the Charmak. \n\nNever before had the Charmak bothered to study the structure of the societies they terrorized, and while revelation that it's possible to select one's leaders based on something other than their capacity for violence did not impress them at first, it had a profound effect on their psyche in the long run. The more their thought about this, the more it caused them to doubt the Charmak ways, eventually driving them to compulsive insubordination or deep melancholy, where they would simply refuse to follow orders, even when threatened with death, and ultimately refused to eat, drink and maintain their ships. \n\nWithin a decade, their entire society had collapsed and their once fearsome species became extinct. Their flagship, the §YCharmakaradum§!, remains however, and we can restore it back to working condition."
